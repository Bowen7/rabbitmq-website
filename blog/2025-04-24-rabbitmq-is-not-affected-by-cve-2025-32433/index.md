RabbitMQ is not affected by [CVE-2025-32433](https://github.com/erlang/otp/security/advisories/GHSA-37cp-fgq5-7wc2),
a vulnerability in the Erlang's SSH library. RabbitMQ does not use SSH, neither the server nor the client parts.

## Team RabbitMQ's Erlang Packages Do Not Include SSH

Team RabbitMQ produces [a zero dependency Erlang RPM](https://github.com/rabbitmq/erlang-rpm/releases)
that does not include the SSH library since it is not used. Our [Debian packages](https://github.com/rabbitmq/erlang-debian-package) are split into multiple fine-grained components,
and the RabbitMQ installation guide [skips SSH library installation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/install-debian).

## Patched Versions Are Available

Team RabbitMQ's [RPM repositories](https://rabbitmq.com/docs/install-rpm) and [Debian repositories](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/install-debian) were updated to include Erlang `27.3.3`, `26.2.5.11` and `25.3.2.20`.

For aarch64 (64-bit ARM) RPM packages, see [`rabbitmq/erlang-rpm` releases](https://github.com/rabbitmq/erlang-rpm/releases).

For aarch64 (64-bit ARM) Debian packages of Erlang `26.2.5.11`, see [this Launchpad repository](https://launchpad.net/~rabbitmq/+archive/ubuntu/rabbitmq-erlang).

RabbitMQ [community Docker image](https://github.com/docker-library/rabbitmq) was also upgraded to Erlang `27.3.3` and `26.2.5.11` last week.
